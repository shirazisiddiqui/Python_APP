##I created this weather app on September 3rd, 2024, exclusively for assessment purposes. I have taken the weather API key from visual crossing. In this app, I am displaying the current weather and 5-day weather forecast of a city. The city name is the only input which the user can enter to see the weather. I have also included icons for a better understanding of the weather conditions of a city. I have taken all icons from visual crossing only and attached all icon's images in this repository. To run this weather app, please make sure to download all icons and change the icon path name from line number 62 to 67 in the weather_app_latest.ipynb file. Also, I have attached a few output window screenshots to see the final output of various cities like Boston, Paris, London and so on.
